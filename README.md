# Web-Scraper
Web Scraper uses openCSV to read file containing urls from automotive magazines that test cars. I then used Jsoup to get performance metrics from testing data of different cars. OpenCSV is used to write a csv file containing names of different cars along with their performance metrics collected from credible autotmotive magazines.
